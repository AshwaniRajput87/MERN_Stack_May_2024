# Project 2 - video streaming server

    -> you can use the same concepts we have discussed and use it to 
        create a video streaming server

    -> Take a movie file 

    -> Read as a stream and pipe the response

    -> On the client side, try using html5 video 

    -> You have to take care of the ranges if the user wants a specific part to 
       be streamed
